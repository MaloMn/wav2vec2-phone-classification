This repository contains Speechbrain recipes to fine-tune Wav2Vec2 models on a phone classification task.
It allows us to analyse the impact of:
  1. Fine-tuning Wav2Vec2,
  2. Pre-training datasets
  3. Model size,
  4. fine-tuning datasets.

  The `recipes` folder contains all Speechbrain recipes.
  Results obtained are available in the `confusion-matrix/` folder.
